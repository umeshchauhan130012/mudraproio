          <h4>A Key Note: Risks Related To Trading of Virtual Assets:
           </h4>
          <p>
            Trading of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies involves significant
            risk.&nbsp;The credit goes to the volatility factor involved in
            trading. Meaning, the virtual asset market is highly volatile. Such
            financial fluctuations bring uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The value of cryptocurrency and reduced demand could be affected
            significantly by a number of factors. The list includes but is not
            limited to the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> The loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency. </li>
            <li> Changes in the development of software.</li>
            <li> Decisions by the government.</li>
            <li> Development of competitive cryptocurrency. </li>
            <li> Technical issues </li>
            <li> Political as well as non-political statements. </li>
            <li> Statements by influencers. </li>
            <li> News </li>
            <li> Hacker-attacks. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You stand a good chance to lose your virtual asset if you lose or
            forget one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Password </li>
            <li> Username</li>
            <li> Private key</li>
            <li> Security code </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The lists of all risks related to the trading of virtual assets and
            cryptocurrencies cannot be defined in this single document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital currencies have special risks. These risks generally do not
            have any relation with the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Official currencies </li>
            <li> Commodities</li>
            <li> Tangible goods.</li>
            <li> Goods registered in the official registry. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency assets are assets that are intangible and
            decentralized digital assets supported by technology or trust.
            Central banks or financial institutions cannot help protect the
            value of virtual currencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decentralized digital currencies are autonomous systems of firms and
            individuals launching cryptocurrencies are unregulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The risk of trading in cryptocurrencies could be significant.
            Therefore, you should be very careful and do some thinking before
            investing in cryptocurrencies. Do not forget to take your financial
            condition into account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep the following to yourself only for the security of your
            account, virtual assets and money:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Username </li>
            <li> Password</li>
            <li> Security codes</li>
            <li> Private Key </li>
            <li> For the rest of the account-related information. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Do not forget to change your password and other key information
            regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
